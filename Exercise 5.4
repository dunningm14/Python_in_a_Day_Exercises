# Purpose: Chapter 5, exercise 4
# 1. Write a function named is_triangle that takes three integers as arguments, and
# that prints either “Yes” or “No,” depending on whether you can or cannot
# form a triangle from sticks with the given lengths.
# 2. Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick lengths,
# converts them to integers, and uses is_triangle to check whether sticks
# with the given lengths can form a triangle.

def is_triangle(a, b, c):
    if (a > b + c) or (b > a + c) or (c > a + b):
        print "No"
    else:
        print "Yes"
